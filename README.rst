Notes
=====

On macOS and Linux, you may need to add the following line to
your `.profile` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    export $PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

On Windows you should check the box during the Python installer
to include `Scripts` directory in your `PATH`.  This can be done
manually after installation too.

Install PyPi release (from pip)
